# Formal Analysis of Bitwise Stability in the Prime Resonance Framework

This repository contains an analysis of bitwise stability within the Prime Resonance Framework, focusing on formal methods to ensure reliability and correctness in bitwise operations. The project explores concepts such as bitwise manipulation, stability under various inputs, and integration with frameworks for prime number computations.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies if needed (e.g., Python for scripts).
3. Run sample scripts to verify bitwise stability.

## Project Structure
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview.
- **src/**: Directory for source code files.
- **analysis.py**: A sample script for bitwise analysis.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x (for running analysis scripts)
- Git (for version control)

## Usage
